# 🧪 API Automation Testing Project

This is a real-world **API automation testing framework** built using **Java, Rest Assured, and TestNG**. It covers complete CRUD operations with dynamic test validation, clean structure, and CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions.

> ✅ Designed to simulate a mini backend product and user management system.  
> 💼 Built as a portfolio-grade project to showcase skills in automation, API testing, and test architecture.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Java** – Programming language
- **Rest Assured** – API testing framework
- **TestNG** – Test runner
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline
- **JSON** – Test payloads
- **Node.js Express Server** – Simulated backend for product tests

---

## ✅ Features

- 🧪 **Automated API test cases** for both products and users
- 📂 External JSON files for clean payload handling
- 🔁 Chained requests using extracted data (e.g., `productId`)
- 🛡️ Response validation using **Hamcrest matchers**
- 🔗 Real API calls to [`https://fakestoreapi.com`](https://fakestoreapi.com)
- 🔧 Local mock server to simulate CRUD
- 🧰 Modular, maintainable test classes
- 🔄 **CI/CD**: Automatic test runs on every push

## 📦 API Test Modules

### 1. **Product API Tests** (`ProductAPITest.java`)

Tests a local server (`http://localhost:3000`) with endpoints like `/products`.

- **Setup**: Clears previous products and creates a new one.
- `createNewProduct`: Sends POST request and stores the returned product ID.
- `getProductDetails`: Uses the stored ID to validate product retrieval.

### 2. **User Management API Tests** (`UserManagementAPITesting.java`)

Targets `https://fakestoreapi.com` and covers:

- `CreateNewUser`: Sends JSON payload to register a new user.
- `ValidateNewUser`: GET call to check user by ID.
- `LoginNewUser`: POST to `/auth/login` with username/password, validates token.

## 🧪 How to Run the Tests

### ▶️ Pre-requisites

- Java 8+
- Maven
- TestNG
- Node.js (for mock server)
- Internet (for Fakestore API)

### ▶️ Steps

```bash

# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/API-Automation-Project.git

# 2. Navigate to project
cd API-Automation-Project

# 3. (Optional) Start local server for products
node server.js

# 4. Run tests using Maven
mvn test

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Runs test suite on every push and pull_request

Uses a matrix to run on multiple Java versions

Fails the pipeline if any test fails

Logs are saved and accessible from GitHub > Actions tab.

 Future Enhancements
AI Integration — 🔮

Coming soon, we will:

Add predictive test selection using AI

Auto-suggest missing tests based on API spec or logs

Leverage OpenAI/Gemini for test case generation
