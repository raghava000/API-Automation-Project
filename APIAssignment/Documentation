Using restassured methods 

We have created a new method for creating new product(post method) which catches and hold the result json values.All this will be in the test annotation and we used testng import to use this.

what ever value we caught in the creating new product method we used that value to extract the json values using get method.
                  
we have created a different class to handle the updating information 

this updating information is nothing whatever we got the details frm the creating new product are updated and stored in a new json

finally whenever i run a testng.xml which have all these classes we get the new json with updated values.

adding to the top of the cream I have added a delete method for the updated values of the json in the create new product class, so whenever i run the testng.xml the old values are not seen only yhe new json values are seen.

to handle all these logics i used a node js server which have all these methods
